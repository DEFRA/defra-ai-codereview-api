# Bug Report: Inconsistent Behavior for Invalid Repository URLs in process_standard_set

## Summary
The `process_standard_set` function in `src/agents/standards_agent.py` exhibits inconsistent behavior when given an invalid repository URL. Instead of raising an appropriate exception as might be expected, the function logs an error and returns `None`. This behavior leads to adjustments in integration tests (e.g., in `tests/test_invalid_repository_integration.py`) and may cause unpredictable error handling in production.

## Description
- **Affected Function:** `process_standard_set`
- **Location:** `src/agents/standards_agent.py`
- **Current Behavior:**
  - When provided with a repository URL such as "http://invalid-repository-url", the function attempts to clone the repository, fails, logs an error mentioning "invalid", and returns `None`.
  - The current implementation catches exceptions, checks if the repository URL contains "invalid", and returns `None` rather than raising an exception.
- **Test Observations:**
  - The integration test in `tests/test_invalid_repository_integration.py` (i.e., `test_invalid_repository_error_handling`) expects this behavior. Initially, the test expected an exception, but was modified to assert a `None` return and an error log message containing "invalid".

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Use a valid standard set ID along with an invalid repository URL (e.g., "http://invalid-repository-url").
2. Invoke the `process_standard_set` function.
3. Observe that instead of raising an exception, the function logs an error and returns `None`.
4. Verify that the integration test in `tests/test_invalid_repository_integration.py` passes based on these criteria.

## Impact
- **Inconsistent Error Handling:** The function does not raise an exception for invalid URLs, which can lead to ambiguous error propagation in production code.
- **Test Reliability:** Tests are adjusted to work around this behavior by expecting a `None` return, which masks the underlying issue rather than resolving it.
- **Maintenance Concerns:** Future developers may be confused by the dual behavior of the function (raising exceptions for some errors but returning `None` for others), impairing debugging and maintenance.

## Proposed Fix Steps
1. **Input Validation:**
   - At the very beginning of `process_standard_set`, validate the repository URL format. If the URL does not meet expected criteria, immediately raise a custom exception (e.g., `InvalidRepositoryError`).
2. **Custom Exception:**
   - Define a new exception class `InvalidRepositoryError` that extends `StandardsProcessingError`.
3. **Error Propagation:**
   - Remove the conditional check that looks for "invalid" in the repository URL inside the exception handler. Instead, allow the custom exception to propagate.
4. **Test Update:**
   - Update the integration tests to expect the raised `InvalidRepositoryError` instead of a `None` return and a logged error message.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the expected behavior for invalid repository URLs and error handling in the API error handling guidelines to ensure clarity for future development.

## Conclusion
Addressing this bug will lead to clearer, more consistent error handling in the `process_standard_set` function, improve test reliability, and enhance maintainability of the codebase. The outlined fix steps provide a roadmap for implementing a robust solution.
