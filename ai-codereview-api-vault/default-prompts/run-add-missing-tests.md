- run `coverage run -m pytest` or `pytest --cov=<your_package>`
- analyze the test coverage and add any missing tests, only add tests that are missing against the current implementation
- look at the percentage of test coverage from the report and focus on the first area without full coverage
- add tests one by one and run the tests after each addition
- Do NOT recommend upgrading java or changing the test framework
- DO NOT add any new code, just add the tests
- Only change one file at a time
