Create a detailed PRD document in an markdown format outlining the following feature requirements.  I want the PRD to be in a single downloadable markdown file.  Ensure you use the best practices standards.  Don't include a table of contents.

(detailed requirements here)

Context: this app is an agentic framework for checking codebases against various standards and reporting the results  

 We have an existing patterns in our codebase, which should be followed for best practice; logging; testing; etc so that the developer should analyse the entire code before making any changes

Include detailed user stories with acceptance criteria in a BBD format, which is testable. 

No explanation is required, just put this into a single markdown file I can download
