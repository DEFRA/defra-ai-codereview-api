   - [x] Setup mock database collections
     - [x] Leverage existing `mock_database_setup` fixture
     - [x] Define specific collection behaviors for test

2. Create test dependencies
   - [x] Database Mocking Setup
     - [x] Extend `mock_database_setup` fixture if needed
     - [x] Mock specific collection methods:
       - [x] `find_one` for standard set lookup
       - [x] `insert_one` for new standards

       - [x] `update_one` for status updates
     - [x] Setup return values for each mock
     - [x] Configure mock side effects for error scenarios
   - [x] Mock Git operations
   - [x] Mock LLM client
   - [x] Setup temporary directory handling

3. Database State Management
   - [x] Define initial database state
     - [x] Pre-existing standard sets
     - [x] Pre-existing classifications
     - [x] Pre-existing standards
   - [x] Setup state reset between tests
   - [x] Configure mock responses for queries
   - [x] Setup verification of database operations

## Test Implementation Tasks

4. Implement main test function

   - [x] Implement assertions

5. Implement assertions
   - [x] Database Operation Verification
     - [x] Verify correct collection methods were called

6. Implement cleanup
   - [x] Database cleanup
     - [x] Reset mock call histories
     - [x] Clear any test data
     - [x] Reset mock configurations
   - [x] Ensure temporary resources are cleaned up
   - [x] Clean mock states

## Error Handling Tasks
