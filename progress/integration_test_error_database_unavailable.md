# Integration Test Checklist: Error Handling - Database Unavailable

This checklist outlines the step-by-step tasks required to implement the error handling integration test for the scenario where the database is unavailable.

- [ ] Step 1: Review the integration test plan in tests/specs/standards_agent_integration_tests.md for the 'Database Unavailable' scenario to understand the expected behavior.
- [ ] Step 2: Create a test fixture for a valid standard set ID and repository URL.
- [ ] Step 3: Simulate the database being unavailable by:
  - [ ] Mocking the database connection to raise an exception when accessed, or
  - [ ] Configuring the test environment to simulate a database outage.
- [ ] Step 4: Invoke the process_standard_set(standard_set_id, repository_url) function within the test.
- [ ] Step 5: Assert that the function raises an appropriate error due to the unavailable database.
- [ ] Step 6: Verify that any temporary resources (e.g., temporary directories, cloned repository) are properly cleaned up after the failure.
- [ ] Step 7: Confirm that no partial data is persisted to the database.
- [ ] Step 8: Check that the error is logged with appropriate context and details.
- [ ] Step 9: Run the test and ensure that all assertions pass.
- [ ] Step 10: Document any additional observations or refinements and update the checklist accordingly once tests pass.
