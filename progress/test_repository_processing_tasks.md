# Repository Processing Test Tasks

## Implementation Decisions

### Mock Strategy
- ✅ Git operations will be mocked to avoid network calls
- ✅ This provides reliable, fast tests while still testing core functionality
- ✅ Trade-off: Some real-world network scenarios won't be tested

### File System Strategy
- ✅ Decision: Using actual file system operations (not mocked)
- ✅ Rationale: 
  - Provides more realistic testing of file operations
  - Tests actual file system interactions
  - Better coverage of file system edge cases
  - More confidence in production behavior
- ✅ Implementation: Use `tempfile` for safe, isolated testing

### Integration Level
- ✅ Mocking external Git operations while testing real file system
- ✅ This balances:
  - Test reliability (mocked Git)
  - Real-world behavior (actual files)
  - Test speed (no network calls)

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Happy Path Tasks
- [x] Basic Repository Download
  - [x] Mock Git clone operation
  - [x] Verify temp directory creation
  - [x] Check returned Path object
  - [x] Validate directory exists
  - [x] Handle directory recreation correctly

- [ ] File Structure Tests
  - [ ] Create test directory structure
  - [ ] Add mixed file types (md, txt, etc)
  - [ ] Verify structure preservation
  - [ ] Check relative paths

- [ ] Markdown Processing
  - [ ] Create sample markdown files
  - [ ] Add nested markdown files
  - [ ] Verify markdown detection
  - [ ] Check content preservation

- [ ] Cleanup Operations
  - [ ] Verify temp directory removal
  - [ ] Check file handle closure
  - [ ] Validate resource cleanup

### 2. Error Case Tasks
- [ ] Invalid Repository
  - [ ] Test non-existent URL
  - [ ] Test malformed URL
  - [ ] Verify error messages
  - [ ] Check cleanup after failure

- [ ] Network Issues
  - [ ] Test timeout scenarios
  - [ ] Test connection failures
  - [ ] Verify error propagation
  - [ ] Check partial cleanup

- [ ] File System Errors
  - [ ] Test permission denied
  - [ ] Test disk full scenarios
  - [ ] Test readonly filesystem
  - [ ] Verify cleanup attempts

- [ ] Process Interruption
  - [ ] Test cancellation
  - [ ] Test timeout handling
  - [ ] Verify partial cleanup
  - [ ] Check resource release

### 3. Integration Tasks
- [ ] Standards Processing
  - [ ] Test with standards agent
  - [ ] Verify database updates
  - [ ] Check classification flow
  - [ ] Validate end-to-end

- [ ] Resource Management
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage
  - [ ] Check file handle limits
  - [ ] Verify cleanup in pipeline

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Infrastructure Setup (2/2)
  - [x] Created test fixtures (mock_git_repo, mock_temp_dir)
  - [x] Set up test file structure
- [ ] Happy Path Implementation (1/4)
  - [x] Basic Repository Download
  - [ ] File Structure Tests
  - [ ] Markdown Processing
  - [ ] Cleanup Operations
- [ ] Error Cases Implementation (0/4)
- [ ] Integration Tests (0/2)

## Notes
- Each task should follow Given/When/Then pattern
- Use existing test utilities where possible
- Follow established naming conventions
- Document any deviations from plan

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
1. Created test infrastructure:
   - Set up mock_git_repo fixture for Git operations
   - Created mock_temp_dir fixture for file system operations
   - Added test_repo_url fixture for consistent URL usage
   - Added cleanup in autouse fixture

2. Implemented Basic Repository Download test:
   - Tests successful clone operation
   - Verifies directory creation and recreation
   - Validates Path object
   - Checks directory existence
   - Handles cleanup properly

### Next Steps
1. Implement File Structure Tests:
   - Create test directory structure
   - Add mixed file types
   - Test structure preservation

### Notes on Test Coverage
- Current coverage is at 41% (below 90% requirement)
- Will need to implement more tests to improve coverage
- Focus on git_repos_agent.py coverage next

### Additional Updates
- [x] Moved test_repository_processing.py and test_standards_agent.py from tests/agents to tests/integration/agents folder (backup retained in tests/agents_backup).
